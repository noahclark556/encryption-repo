# encryption-repo
<h1>Python and mysql based encryption algorithm</h1> 

To run the full program as python, execute the main.py.
To run as executable (exe), execute DoubleEncrypt.exe.

<b>COMMANDS:</b><br/>
c - create and upload a new key/crypto<br/>
e - encrypt using currently uploaded crypto<br/>
d - decrypt using currently uploaded crypto<br/>
clear - clear screen<br/>
exit - exit terminal<br/>

<b>REMARKS:</b>
If you plan on decrypting a message, DO NOT forget<br/>
the seed and double encryption key you used to create the crypto.<br/>
Because if new crypto is uploaded to database, there is no going back <br/>unless you have Seed and DE. <br/>
When encrypting and decrypting with a key, remember the the code reads for spaces. If you do not copy <br/>
white space when placing encrypted code into to decrypter, the outcome will be wrong.
